realtime_dreamer
==============================

This Realtime Dreamer project is to use real Ecommerce data to perform NLP for Vietnamese language and machine learning tasks in order to settle a real-world business challenge of a company in Vietnam . We split our project into below four tasks:


1.	Customer review type classification

Suwasit Wittayaijug used customer reviews to train Phobert pre-trained BERT model and then classify review types such as delivery, product, quality, and service. Performed model evaluation and produced visualizations.


2.	Sentiment analysis for customer reviews

Yunhong He used keyword search method to select positive and negative customer reviews and label them after eye scan. And then used these selected reviews with labels to train trituenhantaoio/bert-base-vietnamese-uncased pre-trained BERT model which will label the customer reviews with emotions such as positive, neutral and negative. Performed model evaluation and visualizations for 3 different pre-trained BERT models including trituenhantaoio/bert-base-vietnamese-uncased, NlpHUST/vibert4news-base-cased and bert-base-uncased, as well as Supervised Machine Learning algorithms. Setup team GitHub with folder structures. Produced sentiment analysis Machine Learning pipeline. /realtime_dreamer/sentiment_analysis.sh file is used to run the sentiment analysis pipeline.

Model performance focus on F1 macro score due to the imbalanced label for negative class. The best BERT model is defined as the pre-trained BERT model with the highest F1 macro score at the best epoch among 10 epochs. It is found that trituenhantaoio pre-trained BERT model outperformed other pretrained BERT models. Therefore model generated by trituenhantaoio at one of the 10 epochs with the highest F1 score macro is chosed as sentiment_analysis_best_bert_model.model.

Sample files:

(1) Customer review label dataset at C:\Users\heyun\Capstone\realtime_dreamer\data\processed\sentiment_analysis_reviews_label.xlsx is the small sample of the file '/content/drive/MyDrive/Realtime Dreamer/train reviews.xlsx' used in notebooks\Sentiment_Analysis_BERT_Model_Evaluation.ipynb. Column "emotion" is labelled by Yunhong He using keyword search method to select positive and negative customer reviews after eye scan.

(2) Customer reviews dataset at C:\Users\heyun\Capstone\realtime_dreamer\data\processed\Git_mockup_reviews_processed.xlsx is the small sample of the customer review file 'drive/MyDrive/Realtime Dreamer/Tefal Lazada Product Reviews in TTL202207_Updated_Good_Bad.xlsx' used in notebooks\Sentiment_Analysis_BERT_Model_Evaluation.ipynb. Column "Comment classified Type 1" is labelled by Vietnamese team.

BERT model evaluation files:

Below evaluation files are generated in Sentiment_Analysis_BERT_Model_Evaluation.ipynb and Sentiment_Analysis_BERT_Model_Evaluation.zip, and are used to produce BERT model evaluation visualizations:

model_info.csv, sentiment_analysis_...accuracy_per_class_df.csv, sentiment_analysis_...eval_df.csv, sentiment_analysis_...eval_VnEmoLex_validated_df.csv,  sentiment_analysis_...accuracy_per_class_VnEmoLex_validated_df.csv, sentiment_analysis_...eval_before_oversample_df.csv and sentiment_analysis_...accuracy_per_class_before_oversample_df.csv.


3.	Recommendation system

Kensuke Suzuki used user id, product and customer rating to train Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering model which will then recommend items to the user. “Users who are similar to you also liked…” Conducted model evaluation.


4.	Machine Learning for Sales Prediction

Zheng Wei Lim used E-Commerce data to train Supervised ML algorithms, conducted feature engineering. Performed model evaluation of multiple Supervised ML algorithms, and produced visualizations.
